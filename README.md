# XSS Detection Using CNNs

## Overview
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) remains a significant threat to web applications, yet it's often underestimated. This project focuses on leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance XSS detection, aiming to fill the gap in effective methodologies for combating XSS attacks.

## Problem Statement
XSS attacks pose a severe risk to web applications, but current detection methods are inadequate. This project aims to develop a CNN-based solution to accurately detect XSS threats and mitigate their impact on web security.

## Dataset
We utilize a diverse dataset comprising both benign and malicious web traffic, allowing our CNN models to learn patterns indicative of XSS attacks effectively.
## Methodology

- **Data Collection:** 
  - Gather a diverse dataset containing both benign and malicious web traffic.
  - Include various types of XSS payloads and legitimate web requests to train the CNN model effectively.

- **Preprocessing:** 
  - Clean and preprocess the dataset to extract relevant features.
  - Normalize and tokenize the data to prepare it for training.

- **CNN Architecture Selection:** 
  - Experiment with different CNN architectures, such as variations of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
  - Optimize the model architecture based on performance metrics and computational efficiency.

- **Training and Evaluation:** 
  - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
  - Train the CNN model on the training data and validate its performance using the validation set.
  - Evaluate the model's effectiveness in detecting XSS attacks using the testing set.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** 
  - Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate to optimize model performance.
  - Utilize techniques like grid search or random search to identify the optimal hyperparameter values.

- **Real-time Detection Implementation:** 
  - Implement the trained CNN model for real-time XSS detection in web applications.
  - Integrate the detection mechanism into existing security infrastructure or deploy it as a standalone solution.

- **Performance Analysis:** 
  - Evaluate the model's performance in real-world scenarios, considering factors like false positive rate, detection speed, and scalability.
  - Compare the CNN-based detection system with existing XSS detection methods to assess its effectiveness.

- **Feedback Loop:** 
  - Incorporate feedback from ongoing monitoring and evaluation to continuously improve the CNN model.
  - Update the model periodically to adapt to emerging XSS attack patterns and evolving web application vulnerabilities.
## Outcome
This project aims to significantly enhance web application security by providing a proactive defense against XSS attacks through the implementation of CNN-based detection mechanisms.
